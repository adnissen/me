#What do I do?
I spend nearly all my free time hacking and building (what I hope is) interesting software. I like to focus mainly on the web, which was my duty as a **programming intern** at <a href="http://www.learninggamesnetwork.org/">**The Learning Games Network**</a> this last summer. While there, I helped define and produce a prototype for a new project (unreleased, related to the <a href="http://www.xenos-isle.com/">**Xenos-Isle**</a> project). I also helped solve bugs in their new, re-designed website, which was launched shortly after my arrival. 

#What have I done?
I've done dozens of small projects and scripts, and a few larger ones of note:

 - Sagacityapp.com, a minimal writing platform (which I use for my blog, as linked above) written entirely in Meteor.
 
 - Irrupt, an award-winning iOS game created with Unity (the first commercial game to utilize the Futile engine).

 - Futref.me, a Meteor app written to store quotes from your friends.

 - isiton(.herokuapp.com), a website / chrome plugin that searches Spotify and Rdio for songs on YouTube automatically.

Apart from these things, I've written many smaller games (getting attention on several Indie Games Blogs) and done many small tools and projects to simply make life easier (for instance a Vagrant file to get Meteor up and running instantly on any computer). 

#If it isn't obvious...
I love what I do. I love working on projects both large and small and just doing cool things in software. I work best with other creative, inspired people that motivate me to go to work every day. As long as a job has that, I can dedicate myself to it.
